# About Me

Hello, my name is Joshua Balila.


I'm a software engineer with a wide array of skills - including full-stack web development, Visual Studio ETL and reporting tools, and a dash of systems programming -
with a passion for learning. I graduated with a <i>Bachelor of Science</i> in <i>Computer Science</i> from the <u>University of Central Florida</u> (UCF) in May of 2023,
and I continue to seek out challenges and opportunities to expand my knowledge as a software engineer.

I am currently employed at Miami-Dade County Public Schools (M-DCPS) as a **Senior Developer** for the department of *Application Development & Client Support*.
