ASIKO is a fun action-adventure game developed in Unity that was made as a callback to the old "stickman" era of games. I worked alongside a team of three others - working mainly on enemy/boss AI - to develop this game in the span of four months. If you would like to give it a try, you can use the link below to download the game on *itch.io*!
