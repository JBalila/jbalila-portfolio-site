**Art-Share** is a prototype of an image-sharing website - developed alongside a team of five - created to demonstrate the basic functionality of such a site in both a web and mobile interface. The site required email-confirmation from users, supported password reset via email, and sported a stylish custom design to lock in the artsy theme!
