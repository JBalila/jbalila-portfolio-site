**Synesthize** is an application developed as a capstone project for my Computer Science degree at the *University of Central Florida (UCF)*. The application uses a microphone to listen to any notes being played, then displays the corresponding color for that note. In addition to helping develop the frontend design, I also took on the responsibilities of Project Manager, coordinating our team of five to meet sponsor-mandated deadlines.

The idea for **Synesthize** came from the real-life phenomenon of *[synesthesia](https://www.webmd.com/brain/what-is-synesthesia)*, in which a person is affected by cross-sensory experiences (e.g., seeing colors while listening to music).
